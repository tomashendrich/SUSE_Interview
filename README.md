Subject: Request for RCA

Reason:

As our communication with customers is mainly done via email, as part of the recruitment process we would like to evaluate written communication. The expected outcome from this exercise is for you to prepare a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for a system crash. It would ideally include a basic health check of the system, the reasons for the crash, and recommendations to fix this and/or any other evident issue.

For this we have prepared the following simulated request:

Description:
